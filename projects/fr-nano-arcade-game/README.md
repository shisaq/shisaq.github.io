# Angry Bugs!

This is a simple game from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) Front-end Nanodegree project 3: Arcade Game

===============================

## Getting started

1. Use narrow keys to control the sprite, trying to go to the river(blue areas)
2. Avoid collision against enemies(bugs) when running
3. You have 3 chances(heart) in a rotation
4. After 3 times losing heart, or when winning the game, press enter to restart
