title: My Fireman - Udacity Digital Marketing Nanodegree
categories:

Actually, I graduated from Udacity Front-end Web Development Nanodegree last August. I know NOTHING about digital marketing, meanwhile I’m a Chinese so I don’t know that much about US culture or the platforms people use in the US.

Recently, I got a chance to have joined in a startup on Feb 23, 2017, as a digital marketer and designer. Not my major, but at least it’s a chance for me to start making money. What attracted me more is the product the startup offers is the world’s first smart ukulele - I love music and ukulele, and tech as well! During the daily digital marketing process and the ads budget that seems doesn’t perform well, I knew this is my circumstance: handle the professional relevant skills or get fired.

OMG, what should I do? How could I get the skills in a short time and help to get a nice ROI? How could I analyze the confusing data and work out the copywriting? I really need someone that can teach me and interact with me on the following days.

Fortunately, Udacity just released Digital Marketing Nanodegree right on the vital time! I know Udacity a lot because I had experienced the whole learning process and I absolutely love the “learn and practice” style! That’s why and how I came to enhance the important instruction and handy videos of Udacity. It’s just a week’s learning, but I can feel there has already a big map of digital marketing in my mind. Udacity is my fireman who successfully saved my biggest problem!
