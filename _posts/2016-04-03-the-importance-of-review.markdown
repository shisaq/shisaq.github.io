I always hate to review stuffs, such as movies, books, and of course the online courses in Udacity. But here I am, willing to say it's really really important to review it because you never know how many treasures you have lost on the first watching.




Honestly, I just finished the beginning of Front-end Engineer -- Intro to Html and CSS. But after the plan I made yesterday, I started to relearn it, finding there are lots of acknowledges I missed at the first time(e.g: [normalize.css] can make your code fit for most browsers). Here I just wanna give myself a tip to keep it in mind that it's always necessary to review it, and it will not bee boring.




Meanwhile, this is my first time to try English Writing. Look it as a good starting.




Come on.
