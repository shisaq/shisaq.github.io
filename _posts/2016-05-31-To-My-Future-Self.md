Hey myself:

Now I'm in Pittsburgh, PA. I don't know where you will be in future. There 
will happen plenty things during the lifetime. What I can handle is, just 
this moment.

## What's my problem

* My English is not good enough, which makes me feel worse on learning 
coding.

* I'm lazy, sometimes.

* My coding skill is basic of the basic.

* I haven't got much experience on coding.

## How will I solve my problem

1. Study the courses in Udacity and get the Nanodegree;

2. Read English materials as much as I can to improve my English;

3. Fix my resume and send it during studying and after having got the 
Nanodegree for my American career;

4. Encourage myself over and over, and read the articles with full of 
positive energy, like [How To Navigate the Up and Downs Of Learning To 
Code](http://www.codeconquest.com/blog/how-to-navigate-the-up-and-downs-of-learning-to-code/), 
[My First Month Coding: An Emotional Roller 
Coaster](http://blog.thinkful.com/post/98829096308/my-first-month-coding-an-emotional-roller-coaster), 
and [Why Learning to Code is So Damn 
Hard](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard).

##What skills do I have now

1. The basic of HTML and CSS;

2. Making [my own website](http://shisaq.com) by using Wordpress;

3. Making movies(I don't know if it is useful on coding);

4. Photoshop;

5. Ukulele. Don't laugh, it's important. :)

##How will what Iâ€™ve learned about having a growth mindset help me reach my goals

It's positive. I will have to experience the roller coaster in coding area. 
It's normal, I should accept it and enjoy the achievements. Growth mindset 
told me that.

##My GOALS

1. I desire to go to work in Google. I LOVE Google. That's my goal. Simple, 
difficult, but full with happiness.

2. I want to rebuild 2 websites: 
[ygshi.life.tsinghua.edu.cn](ygshi.life.tsinghua.edu.cn) and 
[http://www.ju-vv.com/](http://www.ju-vv.com/).

## Questions

1. As far as I know, Front-end is a really fast growing industry. I wonder 
if I can keep up to date of the newest   technology in the future. When I 
were not young, how to keep following the fast steps?

2. Is it easy for me to het hired by Google after finishing the Front-end 
Nanodegree? If not, what else should I do?
